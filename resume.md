## Snr Infra Tech

I lead weekly mentorship sessions for offshore contractors; enhancing their technical competencies in network troubleshooting, high-availability (HA) architectures, and systems automation using tools such as python, terraform, gitlab, and continuous integration and development pipelines (CI/CD). Providing hands-on troubleshooting guidance and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation. I am the designated leader for incidents involving in-store infrastructure. Leveraging syslog analysis, historical performance data, and cross-functional collaboration to drive rapid incident resolution and strategic decision-making to minimize business impact. I participate in blameless postmortems after incidents to identify root causes and prevent future occurrences. Focusing on process improvement rather than individual fault.

I collaborated with Senior Engineers to define and develop a Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) monitoring system based on NewRelic Kentik, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL), and Podman. I assisted in the determination of what Management Information Bases (MIBs) were required to provide efficient observability into a large enterprise scale network with multi-vendor equipment including but not limited to Juniper Networks, Cisco Networks, Aruba Networks, Versa Networks, Palo Alto, A10 Networks, and Eaton.

I collaborate with multiple Platform Engineering teams to mature our NewRelic observability platform as we strive to achieve five nines of uptime. (99.999%)
I tweak and tune alerting conditions using version control best practices and Git Operations (GitOps / DevOps). The alerting I create is actionable, reducing toil. I maintain detailed runbooks for handling common incidents and scenarios to ensure consistent and efficient response. I write high-level troubleshooting documents and supporting architecture diagrams attached to runbooks. I encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement through regular training, knowledge sharing, and adopting best practices.

I maintain a large scale wide area network (WAN) consisting of 300+ retail locations and 3 data center locations. I manage all aspects of layers 1 through 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. I can troubleshoot ethernet over copper and fiber mediums. I can troubleshoot and configure layer 2 protocols such as Rapid Spanning-Tree (RSTP), Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE), and 802.1q (DOT1Q) Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN), Link Aggregation Groups(LAG), Etherchannels, and Port-Channels. I can configure and troubleshoot Layer 3 interfaces on Juniper JunOS and Cisco IOS systems.
