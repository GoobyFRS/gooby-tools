This repo is a bunch of resources I have made for my home lab. Feel free to use them too.

To use my Ubuntu Setup bash script do the following. Always read the code before you execute it.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoobyFRS/gooby-tools/refs/heads/main/ubuntu_setup.sh -o ubuntu_setup.sh
chmod +x ubuntu_setup.sh
sudo ./ubuntu_setup.sh
```
